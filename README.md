## 📂 Project Structure

```text
pulse-masterkit/
│
├── main.py
│
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── daily.yml
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. GitHub Actions triggers the workflow based on a schedule.
2. The workflow starts a virtual machine.
3. Python executes `main.py`.
4. Email credentials are securely loaded from GitHub Secrets.
5. The email is sent automatically to the recipient.

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

Create the following repository secrets:

| Secret Name | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| EMAIL_USER  | Sender Gmail address    |
| EMAIL_PASS  | Gmail App Password      |
| EMAIL_TO    | Recipient email address |

## 📧 Email Automation

The bot sends emails automatically using Gmail SMTP.
